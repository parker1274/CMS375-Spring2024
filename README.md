## Abstract
Name of the Project: 
WPAirways

Purpose of the Project:  
The WPAirways project is designed as an internal management system primarily for WPAirways to streamline their operational processes. This system manages various aspects such as flight scheduling, passenger information, and airport operations. 

Target use:
While initially developed for WPAirways, the platform is designed with scalability in mind, allowing for potential future adaptations to other airline systems. The primary users of this system are airline administrators and operational staff who require efficient access to real-time data to manage daily activities.

Data to use:  
1. Flights Information
2. Reservation Status
3. Flight Status

## Official Description
This course serves as an introductory course in database management systems, focusing on the
user's perspective. The primary goal is to familiarize students with essential concepts in database
systems, provide hands-on experience with contemporary relational database systems, and
establish a strong groundwork for further exploration in advanced database studies. Along with
course assignment and exams students will also form a group and work on semester wide group
database related project. Based on the total student distribution, equal membered group will be
formed. All the groups will open their own public shared Git repository and must name them as
“CMS375-Spring2024”. Every group should come up with their very own project ideas. They are
welcome to check other groups Git repos for motivation. Inter-group collaboration is totally
acceptable and encouraged.

## Goals and Objectives
By the conclusion of this course, you will have the capacity to:
1. Create formal UML diagrams to illustrate the relationships among real-world entities
whose data will be stored in a database.  
2. Collaborate in a small group to design and implement a relational database as a solution
to a practical problem.  
3. Manage and manipulate relational databases through SQL coding.  
4. Explore the comparative significance of SQL and NoSQL database systems.  
5. Examine and execute fundamental security measures to safeguard the integrity of data in
a relational database.
